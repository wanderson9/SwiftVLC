A Swift wrapper around [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html) for iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and Mac Catalyst.

## Why?

Apple's AVFoundation covers a narrow slice of the media landscape. It cannot play MKV, FLAC, or most subtitle formats, and it does not support network protocols like RTSP, SMB, or UPnP. Codec support is limited to what Apple ships. Any app that needs to reach beyond MP4 and HLS eventually runs out of runway.

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) plays virtually everything, and its engine, **libVLC**, is available as a C library you can embed in any app.

The existing iOS wrapper, [VLCKit](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit), is written in Objective-C. It uses delegates, KVO, `NSNotificationCenter`, and manual thread management, which is a faithful reflection of the era it was designed in.

**SwiftVLC** wraps libVLC 4.0 directly in Swift, with no Objective-C layer in between. It is built for `@Observable`, `async/await`, and `VideoView(player)`.

## SwiftVLC vs VLCKit

| | SwiftVLC | VLCKit |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Swift 6 | Objective-C |
| **Bindings** | Direct C → Swift | C → Objective-C → Swift bridging |
| **State management** | `@Observable`, drives SwiftUI directly | KVO, `NSNotificationCenter`, and delegates |
| **Concurrency** | `@MainActor`, `Sendable`, `async/await` | Manual thread dispatch, no isolation |
| **Video rendering** | `VideoView(player)` | Manual `UIView` setup plus drawable configuration |
| **Errors** | `throws(VLCError)`, typed and exhaustive | `NSError` codes |
| **Events** | `AsyncStream<PlayerEvent>` with multiple consumers | `NSNotificationCenter` |
| **libVLC version** | 4.0 | 3.x |
| **PiP** | iOS via public AVKit sample buffers; macOS private backend is SPI opt-in | Not included |
| **Swift 6 safe** | Yes, with strict concurrency | No |

## Features

- `@Observable` player: state, current time, duration, tracks, and volume drive SwiftUI directly.
- `VideoView(player)` handles the rendering lifecycle in a single SwiftUI view.
- Typed errors via `throws(VLCError)` instead of error codes.
- Asynchronous media parsing: `try await media.parse()` with cancellation support.
- 10-band equalizer with libVLC's built-in presets.
- A-B looping, playback rate control, and subtitle and audio delay.
- Picture-in-Picture on iOS with full playback controls; macOS native PiP is available only through an explicit private-API SPI opt-in.
- Network discovery for LAN, SMB, UPnP media sources, and Chromecast and AirPlay renderers.
- 360° video with full viewpoint control over yaw, pitch, roll, and field of view.
- Asynchronous thumbnail generation at arbitrary timestamps.
- `MediaListPlayer` for playlist playback with loop and repeat modes.

## Requirements

- Swift 6.3+ / Xcode 26+
- iOS 18+ / macOS 15+ / tvOS 18+ / visionOS 2+ / Mac Catalyst 18+

## Installation

In Xcode, choose **File → Add Package Dependencies**, paste the repo
URL, and Xcode will pick up the latest release automatically:

```
https://github.com/harflabs/SwiftVLC.git
```

From a `Package.swift` manifest, add a dependency and pin to the
current release. The version string lives on the
[releases page](https://github.com/harflabs/SwiftVLC/releases).

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/harflabs/SwiftVLC.git", from: "x.y.z")
```

The pre-built libVLC xcframework downloads automatically via SPM. It's a large binary (multi-GB unstripped; the release zip is a few hundred MB).

## Quick Start

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftVLC

struct PlayerView: View {
  @State private var player = Player()

  var body: some View {
    VideoView(player)
      .onAppear {
        try? player.play(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/video.mp4")!)
      }
  }
}
```

`Player.play(url:)` expects a direct media stream or file URL. It does
not auto-resolve `.pls` or classic `.m3u` playlist containers; use
`MediaListPlayer` or fetch and parse the playlist to its inner stream
URL before passing it to `Player`. HLS `.m3u8` URLs are supported here
because they are streaming manifests rather than playlists of separate
media URLs.

### Common Operations

```swift
// Playback
let player = Player()
try player.play(url: videoURL)
player.pause()
player.stop()
try player.seek(to: PlaybackPosition(0.5)) // Seek to 50%
try player.setPlaybackRate(1.5)            // 1.5x speed
try player.setAudioVolume(0.8)             // 80% volume
player.isMuted = true

// Tracks
player.selectedSubtitleTrack = player.subtitleTracks[1]

// Metadata
let media = try Media(url: videoURL)
let metadata = try await media.parse()
print(metadata.title, metadata.duration)

// Events
for await event in player.events {
  switch event {
  case .stateChanged(let state): ...
  case .timeChanged(let time): ...
  default: break
  }
}
```

## Showcase Apps

The `Showcase/` directory contains separate folders, targets, and schemes for each showcase lane:

- **iOS.** The existing full-featured app target, also enabled for Mac Catalyst.
- **macOS.** Native macOS app target with the same showcase coverage, adapted into sidebar-driven Mac UI.
- **tvOS.** Native tvOS showcase app target with TV-focused focus navigation and Siri Remote controls.
- **visionOS.** Native visionOS app target with a focused simple playback showcase.

Showcase UI tests live under `Showcase/UITests/`. `iOSUITests` covers the broad showcase flows, and `macOSUITests` now covers the release-critical PiP, deinterlacing, and music-player regressions. `tvOSUITests` is still an empty target shell, and the visionOS showcase does not have a UI-test target yet.

## Testing

The core package uses a comprehensive
[Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swift-testing/) suite
against the real libVLC binary, so regressions in the C bridge surface
immediately rather than hiding behind a fake. Showcase UI tests use
XCTest separately. CI runs the full suite on every push and every pull
request.

```bash
swift test
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-strategy) for test tags,
fixtures, and structure.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harflabs/SwiftVLC.git
cd SwiftVLC
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
swift test
```

`main` tracks the latest released `url + checksum` form of the libVLC binary target. `setup-dev.sh` downloads `libvlc.xcframework.zip` into `Vendor/` and idempotently flips `Package.swift` plus the Showcase package reference to repo-local sources so package development and Showcase builds use the checkout on disk.

| `setup-dev.sh` flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Download the latest release if `Vendor/` is empty; otherwise keep existing. |
| `vX.Y.Z` *(positional)* | Pin to a specific release tag. |
| `--force` | Re-download even if `Vendor/` already exists. |
| `--skip-download` | Only flip local references (`Package.swift` and the Showcase app). Expects `Vendor/` to already exist, which is useful after running `build-libvlc.sh`. |

## Building libVLC from Source

Needed only when bumping `VLC_HASH`, modifying build patches, or preparing a release. Day-to-day Swift development doesn't require it.

```bash
brew install autoconf automake libtool cmake pkg-config gettext
./scripts/build-libvlc.sh --all
```

Expect a full `--all` build to take tens of minutes on Apple Silicon. The script clones VLC at a pinned commit into `scripts/.build-libvlc/`, applies the source patches below, builds every contrib (FFmpeg, dav1d, x264, libass, …) per slice, and assembles the result into `Vendor/libvlc.xcframework`.

### Platform selection

| Flag | Platforms |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | iOS device + simulator |
| `--all` | iOS, tvOS, visionOS, macOS, Mac Catalyst (eight slices) |
| `--ios-only` / `--tvos-only` / `--visionos-only` / `--macos-only` / `--catalyst-only` | Replaces `Vendor/` with that single platform |
| `--tvos` / `--visionos` / `--macos` / `--catalyst` | Adds a platform to the default set |
| `--clean` / `--clean-build` | Wipe `scripts/.build-libvlc/` (the latter rebuilds afterwards) |
| `--hash=<sha>` | Override the pinned VLC commit |

> `*-only` flags **replace** the xcframework; any slices already in `Vendor/` are lost.

### Source patches

VLC master requires a few local patches for SwiftVLC's supported Apple toolchains. The script applies them in-tree on every invocation, idempotently:

1. **Mac Catalyst.** Teaches VLC's build system the `macabi` target triple and guards OpenGLES-only code paths.
2. **visionOS deployment target.** Adds the `xros` target triple so object files are stamped with visionOS 2.0 instead of the installed SDK version.
3. **Xcode 26 LDFLAGS.** Adds `-isysroot` to linker invocations so libSystem resolves.
4. **libtool 2.5 OBJC tag.** Adds `_LIBTOOLFLAGS = --tag=CC` to the `Makefile.am` files that contain `.m` sources. Older libtool versions inferred the tag; 2.5 refuses.
5. **Rust contribs disabled.** `cargo-c 0.9.29` no longer compiles on recent Rust. The only Rust contrib on Apple is `rav1e` (AV1 *encoder*); `dav1d` handles decoding.
6. **`dup3` / `pipe2`.** Forced unavailable via autoconf cache vars. iOS Simulator SDK 26 exports these Linux-only syscalls from libSystem, fooling configure into using them.

`git reset --hard` only runs when HEAD is not at `VLC_HASH`, so the patches and per-platform build dirs survive repeated runs.

## Releasing

Releases advance `main`: `release.sh` rewrites `Package.swift` to the new remote xcframework URL + checksum, pins the Showcase app to that exact SwiftVLC version, tags that commit, uploads the zip as a GitHub Release asset, and then pushes `main` to that same commit. `setup-dev.sh` is what flips a working checkout back to local sources for day-to-day development.

```bash
./scripts/build-libvlc.sh --all          # produces Vendor/libvlc.xcframework
./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z --dry-run     # strip + zip + checksum, no push
./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z               # cut the release
```

What `release.sh` does:

1. Verifies all eight platform slices are present in the xcframework.
2. Copies it to a temp dir, strips debug symbols, zips with `ditto`.
3. Computes SHA-256 via `swift package compute-checksum`.
4. Rewrites `Package.swift` to the remote URL and checksum, and pins the Showcase app to `SwiftVLC` exact version `X.Y.Z`.
5. Commits that change and tags it as `vX.Y.Z`.
6. Pushes the tag first so GitHub can attach the release asset to that exact commit.
7. Uploads the zip to a new GitHub Release.
8. Pushes `main` to the same commit, so `main` always references the latest published xcframework and Showcase package version.

Preflight refuses non-`main` branches, uncommitted changes in `Package.swift` or the Showcase project, pre-existing local or remote tags, and unauthenticated `gh`. If a pre-commit rewrite fails, the script restores `Package.swift` and the Showcase project before exiting. If the tag push succeeds but a later step fails, `origin/main` is still untouched; finish the GitHub Release (or delete the tag) before retrying.

## Acknowledgments

SwiftVLC stands on the work of the [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org/) community. The VLC media player and libVLC are among the most important open-source projects in media, representing decades of work by hundreds of contributors that made it possible to play virtually anything, anywhere.

Thanks also to [VLCKit](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit) for paving the way for libVLC on Apple platforms. VLCKit proved that embedding VLC in iOS and macOS apps was not only possible but practical, and it has powered countless apps over the years. SwiftVLC would not exist without the foundation VLCKit laid.
