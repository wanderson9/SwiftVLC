/// auth / cert / progress prompts, which are effectively impossible to
/// trigger from unit tests. Instead, these tests fabricate a "dialog"
/// pointer from a known-invalid address and rely on
/// `DialogIDStorage`'s one-shot consumption contract: the storage
/// hands the pointer back exactly once, then nil-s itself out.
///
/// Each test takes a unique address from the shared counter so
/// parallel test runs can't collide on the `DialogIDStorage` registry.
/// The pointers are never dereferenced — only used as identity keys
/// and consumption tokens.
