///
/// Serialized because the integration tests all mutate the same
/// `@MainActor` `Player` fields; parallel execution would add
/// scheduling noise without changing coverage. CI also runs `swift
/// test --no-parallel` for the same reason.
///
/// State-transition waits use `subscribeAndAwait` /
/// `subscribeAndAwaitTerminalStop` — the subscription is set up
/// *before* the triggering action so no event can race past it. Each
/// wait is bounded by a 5-second hard timeout that fails the test
/// loudly if a signal never arrives.
