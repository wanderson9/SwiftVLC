/// Reproduction tests for the libVLC debug-build audio-output assertion
/// `assert(stream->timing.pause_date == VLC_TICK_INVALID)` at
/// `src/audio_output/dec.c:876` (and a twin at `dec.c:991` on the
/// pause-entry side). The Showcase uses the default `VLCInstance`
/// (audio-output enabled), so a user who dismisses a screen while the
/// aout is still opening — or who rapid-toggles pause/resume before the
/// first buffer lands — hits that assertion and kills the process.
///
/// These tests build a fresh `VLCInstance(arguments: ["--quiet"])` so
/// the full audio path runs exactly as in the Showcase (audio enabled),
/// unlike the rest of the integration suite which forces `--no-audio`
/// via `TestInstance.makeAudioOnly()`.
///
/// Each scenario targets one narrow window documented in
/// `Player.togglePlayPause` and `TestInstance.swift`:
/// - aout initialization racing with `deinit`'s offloaded stop+release
/// - rapid pause/resume interleaved with the aout opening path
/// - stop fired before `.playing` is ever reached
/// - mixed pause/resume/stop at sub-10ms cadence
/// - concurrent `togglePlayPause` calls from multiple tasks
