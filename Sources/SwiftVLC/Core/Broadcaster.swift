/// Each call to ``subscribe(bufferSize:filter:)`` returns an
/// independent `AsyncStream`. Producers call ``broadcast(_:)`` to send
/// a value to every active subscriber whose `filter` accepts it.
///
/// ## Lock discipline (AB-BA prevention)
///
/// `broadcast` snapshots the matching continuations under the lock and
/// yields *outside* it. If the lock were held during yield, a concurrent
/// task cancellation (which holds the cancelling task's status-record
/// lock and calls `onTermination → unsubscribe → acquire Mutex`) could
/// produce an AB-BA deadlock with `broadcast → acquire Mutex → yield →
/// acquire status-record lock`. Yielding outside the lock breaks the
/// cycle.
///
/// ## Lifecycle callbacks
///
/// `onFirstSubscriber` and `onLastUnsubscribed` let lazy producers
/// (like the libVLC log callback installer) attach to and detach from
/// their upstream source only when there's actual demand. Both callbacks
/// run on a serial reconciliation queue so they can safely make C calls
/// without racing each other.
