///
/// libVLC's decoder, video output, and demuxer subsystems pick a working
/// module by *probing*: each candidate's `Open()` is called in turn, and
/// a failure means "try the next one." A handful of upstream modules log
/// those expected probe failures at `LIBVLC_ERROR`, so a subscriber
/// filtering at ``LogLevel/error`` sees false alarms even when playback
/// is healthy. This filter demotes those specific messages to
/// ``LogLevel/warning`` so ``LogLevel/error`` retains its meaning
/// ("playback actually broke") for downstream consumers.
///
/// The terminal failures emitted by the cascade itself ("no suitable
/// decoder for ...", "Codec 'XXXX' (description) is not supported.")
/// use distinct wording and are untouched. They remain at
/// ``LogLevel/error``.
///
/// **Why not match on the module field?** libVLC 4.0's
/// `libvlc_log_get_context` reports the umbrella library name
/// (`"libvlc"`) rather than the per-module identifier (e.g.
/// `"videotoolbox"`); the per-module info lives in `file` /
/// `psz_object_type` instead. Rather than widen our C shim, the rules
/// below pin tight message-shape patterns that only the noisy emitters
/// ever produce.
///
/// **Performance**: pure function, no allocations, called once per log entry
/// from the libVLC log thread. The early `level == .error` short-circuit
/// means non-error entries (the vast majority) pay one comparison and
/// return. Each rule runs at most one prefix + suffix check or one equality
/// check on the message string. See `LogNoiseFilterTests` for the pinned
/// rules.
///
/// Each rule documents the upstream source location and the structural
/// reason the rule exists. When bumping `VLC_HASH` in
/// `scripts/build-libvlc.sh`, re-verify that those locations and message
/// strings still apply; the unit tests catch wording drift.
